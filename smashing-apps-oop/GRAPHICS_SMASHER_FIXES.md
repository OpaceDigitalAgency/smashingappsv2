# Graphics Smasher Workspace Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Nesting Error ✅
**Problem:** `<button>` cannot appear as a descendant of `<button>` in DocumentTabs.tsx
**Solution:** Changed the outer button element to a `<div>` with `cursor-pointer` class to maintain the same functionality without violating HTML nesting rules.

**File:** `src/tools/graphics-smasher/components/workspace/DocumentTabs.tsx`
**Lines:** 21-55

### 2. React Hooks Order Violation ✅
**Problem:** `handleContextMenu` was defined after an early return statement, causing hooks to be called in different orders between renders.
**Solution:** 
- Moved `BackgroundLayer` component outside of `CanvasViewport` to avoid conditional hook calls
- Moved `handleContextMenu` callback before the early return statement
- This ensures all hooks are called in the same order on every render

**Files:** 
- `src/tools/graphics-smasher/components/canvas/CanvasViewport.tsx` (Lines 1-41, 113-193)

### 3. Dark Mode Styling for Main Navigation ✅
**Problem:** When Graphics Smasher was in dark mode, the main navbar, logo, and menu links remained in light mode, making them hard to see.
**Solution:** Enhanced the dark mode effect in MenuBar.tsx to:
- Apply dark background to the main navbar
- Invert the logo colours using CSS filter
- Change all link and button text colours to white/light grey
- Properly reset all styles when switching back to light mode

**File:** `src/tools/graphics-smasher/components/menus/MenuBar.tsx`
**Lines:** 63-152

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tools/graphics-smasher/workspace
- [ ] Click "Create New" button - should open a new document without errors
- [ ] Verify no console errors appear
- [ ] Check that the canvas viewport displays correctly (not black screen)

### Document Management
- [ ] Create multiple documents
- [ ] Switch between documents using tabs
- [ ] Close documents using the X button on tabs
- [ ] Verify document names and dimensions display correctly

### Canvas Tools
- [ ] Select the Brush tool (B key or click in toolbar)
- [ ] Draw on the canvas - strokes should appear
- [ ] Select the Eraser tool (E key)
- [ ] Erase parts of the drawing
- [ ] Test zoom in/out using mouse wheel
- [ ] Test pan using Hand tool (H key)

### Layer Management
- [ ] Create new layers using Layer menu or shortcut (⇧⌘N)
- [ ] Switch between layers in the Layers panel
- [ ] Toggle layer visibility (eye icon)
- [ ] Lock/unlock layers
- [ ] Reorder layers by dragging
- [ ] Delete layers

### File Operations
- [ ] Open an image file (File > Open or ⌘O)
- [ ] Verify image loads correctly as background layer
- [ ] Save/Export document (File > Save or ⌘S)
- [ ] Export as PNG, JPEG, WebP formats

### Dark Mode
- [ ] Toggle dark mode using the sun/moon icon in menu bar
- [ ] Verify Graphics Smasher interface turns dark
- [ ] Verify main navbar turns dark
- [ ] Verify logo inverts to white
- [ ] Verify menu links turn white/light grey
- [ ] Toggle back to light mode
- [ ] Verify all elements return to original colours

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] ⌘N - New document
- [ ] ⌘O - Open file
- [ ] ⌘S - Save
- [ ] ⌘Z - Undo
- [ ] ⇧⌘Z - Redo
- [ ] ⌘K - Command palette
- [ ] B - Brush tool
- [ ] E - Eraser tool
- [ ] H - Hand tool
- [ ] Z - Zoom tool
- [ ] V - Move tool

### UI/UX
- [ ] All panels (Layers, Adjustments, History, Properties, Assets) open correctly
- [ ] Tool options bar updates when switching tools
- [ ] Zoom indicator shows correct percentage
- [ ] Status bar shows document info and GPU status
- [ ] Context menu appears on right-click
- [ ] Tooltips appear on hover

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation Status
1. **Brush Tool:** Basic drawing works, but advanced features (hardness, flow) are not yet connected
2. **Tool Options:** UI is present but not all options are connected to state
3. **Filters:** Menu items exist but functionality not implemented
4. **Adjustments:** Panel exists but controls not functional
5. **Export:** Basic PNG export works, but layer rendering needs improvement
6. **Selection Tools:** UI exists but selection functionality not implemented
7. **Text Tool:** Not yet implemented
8. **Shape Tools:** Not yet implemented

### Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. Connect ToolOptionsBar controls to canvas interaction state
2. Implement proper layer rendering for export
3. Add selection tool functionality
4. Implement text rendering
5. Add shape drawing tools
6. Implement filters and adjustments
7. Add layer effects (shadows, glows, etc.)
8. Implement proper file format support (PSD, etc.)

## Architecture Notes

### Component Structure
```
GraphicsWorkspace
├── MenuBar (File, Edit, Image, Layer, etc.)
├── ToolOptionsBar (Tool-specific options)
├── DocumentTabs (Document management)
├── ProfessionalToolbar (Tool selection)
├── CanvasViewport (Main canvas area)
│   ├── Stage (Konva)
│   ├── Layers (Konva)
│   └── BackgroundLayer (Image or solid colour)
└── Panels (Layers, Adjustments, History, etc.)
```

### State Management
- Uses Zustand for global state (`graphicsStore.ts`)
- Document state includes layers, viewport, history
- Canvas interaction handled by `useCanvasInteraction` hook
- GPU acceleration via WebGPU/WebGL (canvas engine)

### Key Files
- `src/tools/graphics-smasher/state/graphicsStore.ts` - Main state management
- `src/tools/graphics-smasher/hooks/useCanvasInteraction.ts` - Drawing logic
- `src/tools/graphics-smasher/components/canvas/CanvasViewport.tsx` - Canvas rendering
- `src/tools/graphics-smasher/components/workspace/GraphicsWorkspace.tsx` - Main layout

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Full support (WebGPU available)
- Firefox: Good support (WebGL fallback)
- Safari: Good support (WebGL fallback)
- Mobile: Limited support (touch events need testing)

## Performance Considerations
- Large images may cause performance issues
- GPU acceleration helps with rendering
- Layer count affects performance
- Consider implementing layer caching for better performance
