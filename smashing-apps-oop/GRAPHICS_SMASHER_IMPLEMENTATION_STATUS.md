- ✅ New Layer (⇧⌘N)
- ✅ Zoom In/Out (⌘+, ⌘-)
- ✅ Fit on Screen (⌘0)
- ✅ Actual Pixels (⌘1)
- ✅ Tool shortcuts (V, M, L, W, B, E, T, U, P, H, Z)

## Remaining Work 🚧

### High Priority - Core Functionality

#### Selection Tools (Tasks 15-17)
- ⚠️ Move tool - needs fix for selection movement
- ⚠️ Lasso tool - needs marching ants and proper mask
- ⚠️ Magic Wand - needs implementation with tolerance and contiguous toggle
- ⚠️ Marquee tools - need refinement

#### Tools (Task 18)
- ⚠️ Eyedropper - basic implementation exists, needs refinement

### Medium Priority - Menu Actions

#### Edit Menu (Task 6)
- ⚠️ Free Transform - needs bounding box with handles, Shift to constrain, Enter/Esc

#### Image Menu (Task 7)
- ⚠️ Image Size (resample all layers)
- ⚠️ Canvas Size (9-point anchor, no resampling)
- ⚠️ Crop to selection
- ⚠️ Trim transparent/solid borders
- ⚠️ Rotate Canvas (90°/180°/Flip)

#### Layer Menu (Task 8)
- ✅ New/Duplicate/Delete Layer
- ⚠️ Merge Down
- ⚠️ Move Up/Down
- ⚠️ Lock/Unlock
- ⚠️ Show/Hide
- ⚠️ Group/Ungroup

#### Select Menu (Task 9)
- ✅ All/Deselect
- ⚠️ Reselect
- ⚠️ Inverse
- ⚠️ Modify (Expand/Contract/Feather)
- ⚠️ From Layer Alpha

#### Filter Menu (Task 10)
- ⚠️ Blur (Gaussian)
- ⚠️ Sharpen (Unsharp Mask)
- ⚠️ Desaturate
- ⚠️ Brightness/Contrast
- ⚠️ Levels
- All need live preview modal

#### View Menu (Task 11)
- ✅ Zoom In/Out/Fit/Actual
- ⚠️ Show Grid toggle
- ⚠️ Show Guides toggle
- ⚠️ Show Rulers toggle
- ⚠️ Snap to Grid/Guides toggles

#### Window Menu (Task 12)
- ⚠️ Toggle Layers/Adjustments/History/Properties panels
- ⚠️ Persist state to localStorage

#### Help Menu (Task 13)
- ⚠️ Keyboard Shortcuts modal
- ⚠️ About modal

### Low Priority - Polish

#### UI Fixes (Task 22)
- ⚠️ Cascading submenu hover gap fix
- ⚠️ 150-250ms mouseleave delay
- ⚠️ Arrow-key navigation

#### Coming Soon Removal (Task 23)
- ⚠️ Replace all alert('Coming soon') with implementations or remove

### Testing (Tasks 24-27)
- ⚠️ Unit tests for History Manager
- ⚠️ Unit tests for Command Registry
- ⚠️ E2E tests for core workflows
- ⚠️ Final integration testing

## Technical Notes

### What's Working Well
1. **Command Registry** - Centralized command execution is clean and extensible
2. **Export System** - renderDocumentToCanvas properly composites all layers
3. **Project Save/Load** - .gsv format works for round-trip editing
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - All route through Command Registry correctly
5. **Context Menu** - Properly integrated with Command Registry

### Known Issues
1. **Selection Tools** - Need proper mask implementation and marching ants
2. **Transform** - Needs bounding box UI with handles
3. **Filters** - Need WebGL/WebGPU implementation for performance
4. **Layer Operations** - Merge/Group need canvas composition logic
5. **Focus Issues** - Some shortcuts may not work after certain tool usage

### Architecture Decisions
- **Command Pattern**: All actions go through CommandRegistry for consistency
- **History Manager**: Separate from Zustand store for better control
- **Export**: Offscreen canvas composition for accurate rendering
- **Project Format**: JSON-based .gsv for human-readable projects
- **Quality Settings**: Prompt-based for JPEG/WebP (could be modal in future)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Selection Tools** - Critical for basic editing workflow
2. **Implement Image Menu** - Rotate/Flip/Crop are commonly used
3. **Add View Toggles** - Grid/Guides/Rulers for precision work
4. **Remove "Coming Soon"** - Either implement or remove menu items
5. **Add Help Modals** - Keyboard shortcuts and about
6. **Write Tests** - Ensure nothing breaks
7. **Polish UI** - Submenu hover, focus issues

## Estimated Completion

- **Core Functionality**: 60% complete
- **Menu Actions**: 40% complete
- **Tools**: 50% complete
- **Testing**: 0% complete
- **Overall**: ~45% complete

The foundation is solid with the Command Registry and History Manager in place. The remaining work is primarily implementing the individual menu actions and tool behaviors.
